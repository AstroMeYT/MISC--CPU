This is a virtual CPU that runs my custom architecture called MISC-!

## What is it?
This CPU runs a custom architecture called MISC-I (Minimal Instruction Set Computing - One), which I designed and created. The CPU is built in Scratch and the source code is in ```.SB3``` format. It has 15 instructions it is capable of running, and it is capable of reading and writing to 99 separate registers. Further info is in the Wiki.
